# Text Generators
Repository containing projects related to text generation using Artificial Intelligence, a subfield of Natural Language Processing.

The main purpose here is to explore different architectures and datasets, to see if is relatively easy and possible for a simple neural network to capture the structure of a text (i.e poetry) and create new texts. 

The very first project in this area is a LSTM that generates poetry based on Machado de Assis' works. It uses 4 of his brilliant books to capture his essence, characteristics and text structure and generates new poetry based on a _seed text_ (a short sentence that is the beggining of the generated poem).

I created a Jupyter Notebook, which runs on Google Colab, that uses the model to generate poetry. It can be found in [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pedrohortencio/text-generator/blob/main/Poetry%20Generator/Generate_a_Random_Poetry.ipynb) and is very easy to use, but it's in Portuguese for now. The code used to create the model is avaiable [here](https://github.com/pedrohortencio/text-generator/tree/main/Poetry%20Generator).
